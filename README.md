Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client was The Gaming Room They wanted a game called Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  The requirments and design contraints where my strongest part in developing this documentation.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Knowing exactly what I needed and what I did not need.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would of went more indepth on the last section of the document.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  It was important as its the only part that mattered in the end as it is their product in the end.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I would find a good templete and build off that to help make sure I didn't miss anything simular to what was given here.
